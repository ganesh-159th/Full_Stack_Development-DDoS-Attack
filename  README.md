# DDoS Detection Project

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection system using entropy computing. The program calculates the entropy of network traffic data and determines whether a potential DDoS attack is occurring based on a configured threshold.

## Features

- **Entropy Computing:** Utilizes entropy calculation to analyze patterns in network traffic data.
- **Configurable Threshold:** Adjustable threshold for detecting potential DDoS attacks.
- **Path Configuration:** Ability to specify paths or keywords associated with DDoS attacks through configuration.
- **Logging:** Basic logging using log4j2 for recording important events.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Gradle (for building and managing dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ganesh-159th/ddos-detection-project.git
